Densely connected clusters: Communities can represent clusters of roads or intersections that are highly connected by strong edges, indicating that there are many vehicles traveling between these nodes. These clusters may represent areas with high traffic volume or congestion.
Functional modules: Communities can also represent functional modules or sub-networks that are involved in specific transportation tasks or functions. For example, a community might represent a group of roads that are used for commuting to work or school, or a group of intersections that are used for freight transportation.
High-cohesion groups: Communities can represent groups of roads or intersections that are highly cohesive, meaning that they are more likely to be used together by vehicles traveling between different locations. For example, a community might represent a group of roads that are used for traveling between two major highways or a group of intersections that are used for accessing a major transportation hub.
